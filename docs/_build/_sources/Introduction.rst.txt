Interact
--------

A simple python library to interact and build applications with Large Language Models.

Core Concept
------------

``Interact`` has three main components / assumptions:

- Entities in an application communicate through ``Message`` s.
- ``Message`` s are passed through ``Handler`` s that can modify (transform, format, etc.) the ``Message``.
- ``Handler`` s are chained together to form a ``Cascade``. ``Cascade`` s hold a sequence of ``Handler`` s that are executed in order.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/pritam-dey3/interact

Example Usage
-------------

We will build a simple application that generates a company name and tagline based on a product. We will do this in two steps:

- Generate a company name based on a product.
- Generate a tagline based on the company name and product.

Importing neccessary modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    import openai
    from interact.base import Cascade, Handler, Message
    from interact.handlers import OpenAiLLM

    openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

Define handlers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We define two ``Handler`` s, ``CompanyNamePrompt`` and ``CompanyTaglinePrompt`` that will generate the prompts for the company name and tagline.

.. code-block:: python

    class CompanyNamePrompt(Handler):
        role = "CompanyNameGenerator"
        prompt = (
            "What would be an appropriate name for a business specializing in {product}?"
        )

        async def process(self, msg: Message, csd: Cascade) -> str:
            new_msg = self.prompt.format(product=msg.primary)
            csd.vars["product"] = msg.primary
            return new_msg


    class CompanyTaglinePrompt(Handler):
        role = "CompanyTaglineGenerator"
        prompt = (
            "What would be an appropriate tagline for a business specializing in {product}"
            " and with company name {company_name}?\nFormat your output in the following"
            " format:\n<company_name>: <tagline>"
        )

        async def process(self, msg: Message, csd: Cascade) -> str:
            new_msg = self.prompt.format(
                company_name=msg.primary, product=csd.vars["product"]
            )
            return new_msg
            
Note that:

- The ``process`` method of the ``Handler`` s are used to modify the ``Message`` s.
- The ``process`` method of each ``Handler`` takes in the last ``Message`` and the ``Cascade`` which the ``Handler`` is a part of and currently executing in.
- ``CompanyNamePrompt`` creates a variable ``product`` in the ``Cascade``. Variables stored in ``Cascade.vars`` are accessible to all ``Handler`` s in the _current_ ``Cascade``.
- ``CompanyTaglinePrompt`` uses the ``product`` variable to format its prompt.

Define the Cascade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We chain the ``Handler`` s using the ``>>`` operator to form a ``Cascade``. Then we start the ``Cascade`` by calling the ``start`` method with the initial ``Message`` "socks".

.. code-block:: python

    name_and_tagline_generator = (
        CompanyNamePrompt() >> OpenAiLLM() >> CompanyTaglinePrompt() >> OpenAiLLM()
    )
    print(asyncio.run(name_and_tagline_generator.start("socks")).last_msg)
    # The Sock Spot: Step into Comfort

Why Interact?
-------------

Applications with Large Language Models can get complex very quickly. You need more customizability and control over the prompts and their execution to satisfactorily build an application.

``Interact`` was created with simplicity and scalability in mind. The core concepts of ``Message`` s, ``Handler`` s, and ``Cascade`` s are simple to understand and give *You* the power to build complex applications with ease.

More popular alternatives like ``langchain`` get frustrating to use when you want to customize either the process or the prompts according to your needs. ``Interact`` gives you control while maintaining a very simple and intuitive API.
