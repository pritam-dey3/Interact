Why Interact?
-------------

Applications with Large Language Models can get complex very quickly. You need more customizability and control over the prompts and their execution to satisfactorily build an application.

``Interact`` was created with simplicity and scalability in mind. The core concepts of ``Message`` s, ``Handler`` s, and ``Cascade`` s are simple to understand and give *You* the power to build complex applications with ease.

More popular alternatives like ``langchain`` get frustrating to use when you want to customize either the process or the prompts according to your needs. ``Interact`` gives you control while maintaining a very simple and intuitive API.
